# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to investigate reviews from both Amazon's paid and unpaid vine review program. I did run into issues with errors during this analysis, however when I reached out to the BCS learning assistants we found that while an error was displaying in google colab, my code was still running properly in PgAdmin in order to make my tables which we found interesting. Please see below for screenshots of my tables.

## Summary
* After reviewing the percentage of 5 star reviews there does not appear to be a positivity bias due to vine reviews being 52.38% and non vine reviews being 57.8%, the proportion of 5 star reviews is similar. 
* Another analysis I would run is possibly looking at the 1 star reviews in order to see if there may be bias if we dig deeper.
